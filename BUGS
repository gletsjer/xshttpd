This program expects that RFC2553 defined functions and constants are
available on your system. The configure script will autodetect the
presence of these functions. If these functions are not available, the
program will still function properly. However reverse nameserver lookups
(e.g. for logging) won't work without the getnameinfo() function.

On systems with IPv6 support, but no support for combined IPv4-IPv6
sockets (such as FreeBSD-5), you will need to explicitly specify
ListenFamily to clarify which socket the server should bind to.
If you want both IPv4 and IPv6 on such a system, you will need two
<Socket> sections in the httpd.conf, one with either ListenFamily.
