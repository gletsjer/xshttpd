                                COPYING POLICIES

          Permission is hereby granted for copying and distribution of
          copies  of  the  XS-HTTPD source files, and that of any part
          thereof, subject to the following license conditions:

          1.   You may, without additional permission from the author,
          distribute  XS-HTTPD  or  components  of  XS-HTTPD,  with or
          without  additions  developed  by  you  or  by  others at no
          charge.   You  may  also  distribute XS-HTTPD along with any
          other  product  for  sale,  provided  that  the  cost of the
          bundled  package  is the same regardless of whether XS-HTTPD
          is  included,  and  provided  that  those interested only in
          XS-HTTPD  must  be  notified  that  it  is  a product freely
          available from the XS-HTTPD home page.

          2.   You may, without additional permission from the author,
          distribute  copies  of  the  XS-HTTPD documentation, with or
          without additions developed by you or by others at no charge
          or  at  a  charge  that  covers  the cost of reproducing the
          copies,  provided  that  the  XS-HTTPD  copyright  notice is
          retained.

          3.   Furthermore,  if  you  distribute  XS-HTTPD software or
          parts  of  XS-HTTPD,  with or without additions developed by
          you  or  others,  then  you  must  either make available the
          source  to all portions of the XS-HTTPD system (exclusive of
          any  additions  made  by  you or by others) upon request, or
          instead  you  may notify anyone requesting source that it is
          freely available from the XS-HTTPD home page.

          4.   In  addition,  you  may  not  omit any of the copyright
          notices  on either the source files, the executable file, or
          the documentation, and

          5.   Also,  you  may  not  omit transmission of this License
          agreement  with  whatever  portions  of  XS-HTTPD  that  are
          distributed.

          6.  Lastly, any users of this software must be notified that
          it  is without warrantee or guarantee of any nature, express
          or implied, nor is there any fitness for use represented.

          Software  is  a  malleable thing - especially UNIX - and the
          author  can in no way guarantee that using this program will
          not  cause  grievous  damage to your system.  Of course this
          isn't  anticipated, but if it does happen, the author cannot
          be held liable for any damages either directly or indirectly
          caused by this event.

          Modification of the daemon is encouraged, providing that the
          portions  of  the  system  that  are from the original still
          carry the appropriate copyright notices and that the changed
          sections are clearly delimited as such.  The author requests
          copies  of  any  changes  made  to  ensure  that the various
          versions  stay  reasonably  in sync with each other.  Please
          send all revisions to <xs-httpd@stack.nl>

          NOTE   that   it  is  not  permitted  to  copy,  sublicense,
          distribute  or  transfer any of the XS-HTTPD software except
          as expressly indicated herein.  Any attempts to do otherwise
          will  be  considered  a  violation  of this license and your
          rights to the XS-HTTPD software will be voided.

          Comments  on  the  daemon and/or this licensing agreement is
          encouraged.   If you have anything you want me to know, send
          electronic mail to <xs-httpd@stack.nl>

          This  license was largely copied from the ELM license, which
          was written by Scott McGregor and Dave Taylor.
