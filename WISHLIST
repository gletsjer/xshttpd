- Get rid of environment vars (at least reading)
- Get rid of global vars (rw) - use a session struct
- Redo Perl/Python support: current implementation is crippled
  because of closed fds and permission drop (setuid)
- Make FastCGI usable
- Global vhost redir (in httpd.conf?)

- More intelligent http header (qvalue) parsing => sorted mapping
