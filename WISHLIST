- Clean up (layout) manpages
- Get rid of environment vars (at least reading)
- Get rid of global vars (rw) - use a session struct
- Mechanism to add extra HTTP header to error script
- Show 400 error on invalid hostname (tricky with vhost subdirs)

- Redo Perl/Python support: current implementation is crippled
  because of closed fds and permission drop (setuid)

- vhost logging: set host as virtualhostdir name
- digauth support in xschpass
- comb xschpass (it'll overwrite half of .xsauth on error)
- Config file layout/parsing

FreeBSD: depends on netpbm
