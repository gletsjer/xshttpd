- Get rid of environment vars (at least reading)
- Get rid of global vars (rw) - use a session struct

- Redo Perl/Python/FastCGI support: current implementation is crippled
  because of closed fds and permission drop (setuid)

- digauth support in xschpass
- fix/cleanup xschpass (it'll overwrite half of .xsauth on error)

- User configurable decompress options
- More intelligent http header (qvalue) parsing => sorted mapping

- Authentication for POST only
