XS-httpd 3.7 introduces a system for including webserver modules
into the server daemon. These modules can be hooked into the server
at specific locations and may provide additional features that
are not a core part of the webserver.

Examples of such features are a persistent CGI script interpreter
(e.g. for Python scripts) or an external authentication module.
Often these modules will use an external system library.
The webserver daemon itself no longer needs to be linked directly
with these external libraries.

The modules may be customisable by the administrator or users via
the global (httpd.conf) and local (.xsconf) configuration files.

Every module must fill in a 'struct module <name>_module' variable
(as defined in modules.h): this sets the module name and a list
of callback functions that may be executed from the 'hooks'
in the webserver.

At the moment the following hooks are available. This list will
likely be extended in the near future:

init		module initialisation
file_handler	handle representation (interpretation) of a stored file
auth_basic	perform basic authentication (username, password)
auth_digest	perform digest authentication (username, cookie)
config_general	read global configuration options (httpd.conf)
config_local	read local configuration options (.xsconf)

Note that config_* functions will be called with NULL arguments
before a configuration file is parsed: this may be used by the module
to reset its previous configuration values.
