.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual describes the behaviour of @SERVER_IDENT@.
.Pp
Note that the server must run as root in order to use a port number 
below or equal to 1024 (the default is 80).
Also, to have users' CGI binaries executed under their own user ID,
the webserver should be started with root privileges.
.Pp
The server has a number of command line options. These are listed below,
starting with the options that do not have an equivalent
configuration file setting:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Fl c Ar configfile
Uses the specified configuration file instead of the default.
The default location can be displayed using the
.Fl v
option.
.It Fl P Ar preprocessor
Run the preprocessor command to parse the global configuration file,
for example
.Ql m4
or
.Ql cpp .
A fixed preprocessor program can also be set at compile time.
.It Fl m Ar service\-message
If you give this option to the server, it will not function as it normally
would. Instead of supplying documents, all it will do is display the
.Sy service\-message .
This is very useful to at least give users an idea of what you are doing
when the server is temporarily out of order. Remember that if you are
supplying an entire sentence, then you have to enclose that sentence in
quotes (").
.It Fl N
This option disables reading of the configuration file and writing of
logfiles and pidfile. This can be useful for testing, non-superuser
execution or in combination with the -m option.
.It Fl v
Shows the server version number and certain compile options.
This does not launch a daemon but exits immediately.
.El
.Pp
Additional options may be specified on the command line or in the httpd.conf
configuration file. Please use the more flexible configuration file for all
standard settings, see
.Xr httpd.conf 5
for details.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Fl p Ar portnumber
Listen for incoming HTTP requests on port
.Sy portnumber
instead of the default (the factory default is 80).
.It Fl u Ar username
Runs the server under
.Sy username Ns ' s
user id instead of the default (the factory default is nobody).
This option is only available when running as root and the selected
user should be unprivileged (it can not be
.Li root ) .
.It Fl g Ar groupname
Runs the server under
.Sy groupname 's
group id instead of the default
.Li nogroup .
.It Fl n Ar number
Uses
.Sy number
as the number of servers to start (the factory default is 20).
.It Fl d Ar rootdir
Uses 
.Sy rootdir
as the base directory for other directories like the logs directory, the
htdocs directory and the cgi\-bin directory. The factory default
.Sy rootdir
is
.Pa @rootdir@/ .
.It Fl a Ar address
Uses
.Sy address
as the internet address to listen on. This name may be used in
redirects, so the fully qualified domain name for this address
should be used.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Server design
XS-httpd has some important features that distinguishes it from other
well-know webservers. The following list highlights the main concepts:
.Bl -tag -width 2m
.It Sy \(hy Small and fast
The webserver was designed to be small and fast. Although it should be
fully standards-compliant, it does lack some of the more elaborate
features that other servers offer. 
.Pp
An imortant design choice is to run with pre-forked processes: which
means it doesn't start up a new client process for every connection to
the webserver. This has advantages and disadvantages, but in general
leads to a faster response and less overhead.
.It Sy \(hy Multi-user environment
The server can be used on a multi-user system where every user has their
own website(s). The webpages will be retreived under the user's uid, so
there is no need to make documents with sensitive data (such as database
passwords) readable to other users on the same server.
.Pp
CGI scripts, server-side include controls (SSI) and server-side
interpreters (PHP, Python) will run with full user privileges as well.
This gives the users a lot of flexibility to organise their own webspace
and also limits the effect of problems with a user's scripts to their
own environment. See
.Xr httpd_cgi 7
and
.Xr httpd_ssi 7
for detailed descriptions.
.It Sy \(hy Full user control
It should be possible for skilled users to exercise a great deal of
control over their own webspace. The ability to run CGI binaries in any
language or choose local interpreters and mime-types for any document is
an important aspect of this.
.Pp
But users can also limit access to (part of) their webspace to certain
visitors using (built-in) HTTP authentication with freely choosen
usernames and passwords. Users can choose for Basic or Digest
authentication, or even configure access using SSL client-certificates,
or blocking/allowing certain IP ranges.
.Pp
Ofcourse the amount of control a user actually has can be limited by the
webserver administrator. It is for instance possible to set resource
limits on user scripts, or even disable the feature completely in the
global configuration file.
.El
.Ss Automatic decompression
One of the nice features of the WWW server is automatic decompression.
This feature is dealt with in the file called
.Pa compress.methods .
.Pp
This file lists the possible compression types that are understood by the
WWW server. It works very simply: if somebody asks for (for example)
.Pa index.html ,
and this file does not exist, but
.Pa index.html.gz
does exist, then
.Pa ndex.html
will be `generated' out of
.Pa index.html.gz
using the method specified with
.Sy .gz .
Note that this process does not actually create
.Pa index.html
in that same directory. It creates a file in the temporary directory,
which is removed immediately after usage.
.Pp
In the case that the browsers accepts certain document encodigings (gzip
is quite common) and the document is stored on disk in an acceptable
format, then the server won't even bother to decompress the document
himself, but will send it to the client compressed as it is, so that the
browser will extract it itself before presenting the document to the
user.
.Pp
If somebody asks directly for
.Pa index.html.gz ,
he will get it in the compressed format. This way, nice things like the
following can be done:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
Get <A HREF="xshttpd.tar">the uncompressed tar</A>,
or get the <A HREF="xshttpd.tar.gz">the compressed tar</A>.
.Ed
.Pp
The user only has to have the compressed version, because if somebody
asks for the uncompressed version, the server will uncompress it on the
fly for that user.
.Pp
Note that only one compression type per file is possible. Of course, you
can make frontends for types that require multiple filters. In that case,
it can be helpful to know that the list is traversed from top to bottom.
.Ss Authentication
This server supports the
.Sy basic
and
.Sy digest
HTTP authentication protocols. This means that users can protect their
pages with a username/password combination. Other servers can do this as
well, but they lack one thing: the
.Qq protected
files often have to be world\-readable. Because our server
retrieves pages under users' own uid, this problem is avoided.
.Pp
Basic authentication does not provide (password) encryption. If you are
worried about other parties intercepting your communications, you should
configure
.Sy SSL
(as explained below).
More information about setting up authentication paswords can be found
in the manual pages of
.Xr xspasswd 1
and
.Xr xsauth 5 .
.Pp
Authentication can also be handled using SSL client certificates.
However this requires the user to deal with
.Ev SSL_*
environment variables in an CGI environment. See the description of the
available CGI variables in
.Xr httpd_cgi 7 .
.Ss Secure Sockets Layer
The webserver supports secure https connections as well as normal http.
However if you want to do both, you will need to run seperate instances,
one with
.Sy UseSSL
(or the command line option
.Fl s )
set and one without.
.Pp
To use SSL you will need an x509 certificate
.Pa ( cert.pem )
and the corresponding private key
.Pa ( key.pem ) .
If you don't have certificates -or a certificiate authority to give
these to you- then you can create the required files yourself using
.Xr openssl 1 .
.Pp
The two
.Pa *.pem
files are usually stored in the httpd config directory. You can use
other filenames for the certificate and private key by setting the
parameters
.Sy SSLCertificate
and
.Sy SSLPrivateKey
in the configuration file.
.Pp
An example SSL-Makefile that can help you generate the certificate,
can be found in the httpd source distribution.
.Ss Additional HTTP/1.1 features
Several new features were derived from the RFC 2616 standard:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Persistent connections (multiple get/post requests per connection)
.It
Additional http methods (OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE and TRACE)
.It
Chunked transfers (both for input and output)
.It
Content trailers (additional headers following end of data)
.It
Conditional requests (If-*, Accept-*)
.It
Content entity tags (ETag) and digests (MD5 checksum)
.El
.Ss Built-in support for common tasks
XS-httpd configuration files, server-side includes and several
additional programs make certain tedious tasks a lot simpler for the
common user. Examples are:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Pagecounters served using server-side includes: daily or total
pageviews can be included in text or in graphical fonts.
.It
Easy configuration of headers that describe the content: the
mime-type, character set and language of documents can be set per file,
file extension or directory tree by the user.
.It
Allow user-settable redirects (HTTP 301, 302 code), server-side
filename rewriting rules or proxying to have the server retreive
contents from another backend server.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
All environment variables which were set when the program was started
will be ignored. These are not available to CGI scripts or other child
processes. See
.Xr httpd_cgi 7
for the variables that will be available within the httpd environment.
.Sh FILES
The global configuration file is
.Pa httpd.conf :
this should be configured by the site administrator before starting
the webserver. All available settings are explained in
.Xr httpd.conf 5 .
.Pp
There are several files that this WWW server considers special when
they appear in the HTML documents directories. These files start with a
dot (hidden) and contain special instructions for the webserver that
apply to a sigle file or all files in a directory (and underlying
subdirectories).
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It .xsconf
This file provides a generic interface to set a lot of the options
mentioned below, specifically for a certain file or group of files.
It allows you to set file-specific mimetype, character set, passwords
and other access restrictions. See
.Xr xsconf 5
for full details.
.It .noxs
If this file exists in a certain directory, that entire
directory is considered closed. If somebody attempts to
retrieve a file from that directory, he will get a
.Ql Permission denied
notice. This is useful for users and system administrators: users can
use it when they are updating the directory and system administrators
can use it to easily shut down a group of pages. This applies to
subdirectories as well.
.Pp
It is possible to allow access to this directory for a limited
number of hosts. You can list the IP-addresses to which access
should be granted in this file (one address per line). This works
for IPv4 as well as IPv6 addresses. Or you can use CIDR notation to
allow an entire subnet. So including "131.155.140.0/23" will unblock
131.155.140.0 - 131.155.141.255.
.It .xsuid
If this file exists in a certain directory, all files in that
directory will be retrieved as (by default) nobody/nogroup
instead of under your own UID. This can be useful if you want
a file permission of say 600 to mean: do not allow retrieval
(by default, the file is retrieved under your own UID, so the
daemon could have still read those files).
.It .redir
If this file is present in a certain directory, and a file
is requested from that directory, then a redirection message
will be sent to the remote user's browser. See
.Xr xsredir 5
for the format of this file.
.It *.redir
If a (regular) file is requested and a file exists with the same
name but with
.Pl .redir appended to it, then the client will be redirected to the URL
that is mentioned in this *.redir file.
.It *.Redir
The same as 
.Ql *.redir ,
however instead of a temporary redirection (302) a permanent redirection
(301) will be sent.
.It .charset
If this file is present in a certain directory, then all files
requested from that directory will get an extra HTTP header which
indicates the character set used, as specified by the contents
of the .charset file. Usefull settings are e.g. UTF-8, ISO-8859-1,
KOI8-R.
.It *.charset
Sets the character set for a specific file (see *.redir).
.It .mimetypes
This file lets a user override the contents of the global
.Pa mime.types
file. The syntax of this file is exactly the same as that for the global
configuration file, but it applies (recursively) to the local
subdirectories.
.It .xsauth
If this file exists, all files in that directory and
subdirectories are protected by usercode/password
combinations. See
.Xr xsauth 5
for more details about this.
.It .xsscripts
This file lets a user override the contents of the global
.Pa script.methods
fP file. The syntax of this file is exactly the same as that for the
global configuration file and it applies (recursively) to the local
subdirectories. See
.Xr xsscripts 5
for more information.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Sy httpd
returns status 0 when it starts succesfully and the daemon will continue
to run in the background. If any fatal error occurs, additional
information should be available in the logfile
.Pa logs/error_log .

.Sh BUGS
Support for the alternative document processing methods using internal
.Sy Perl ,
.Sy Python
or
.Sy FastCGI
hooks is still highly experimental and not very useful.
These features should not be used in a production environment.
