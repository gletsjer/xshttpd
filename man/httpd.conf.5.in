.Dt HTTPD.CONF 5
.Os xs-httpd/3.5
.Sh NAME
.Nm httpd.conf
.Nd XS-httpd configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The httpd.conf configuration file has the following general layout:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
 ... global options ...

 <System>
 ... options for main site ...
 </System>

 <Virtual>
 ... options for virtual host ...
 </Virtual>

 <Users>
 ... options for user homedirs ...
 </Users>

 <Socket>
 ... options for binding specific sockets ...
 </Socket>

.Ed
The file can have only one
.Sy System
and one
.Sy Users
section, but multiple
.Sy Virtual
sections (one per virtual hostname). Keep in mind that there
are fall-back defaults for all options: you are not required
to use a configuration file and leaving out an option does
not mean it will be automatically disabled.
.Pp
Option names and their values must be separated by whitespace.
Option values in the configuration file should not be quoted
using single or double quotation marks.
Note that a
.Ar boolean
value in the configuration file should always be entered as
.Ql true
or
.Ql false .
.Pp
The overview below includes default values listed in angle brackets,
however these defaults may be different on your system, depending
on compile time selections and detected system features.
Any command line options will override settings in your configuration
file.
.Pp
.Ss Global Options
The following options can be set in the global section:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy PidFile Ar filename Aq /var/run/httpd.pid
The file to store the current pid and the last startup
command line. This will be used by
.Xr httpdc 1
for restarting and other maintenance commands.
.It Sy UserId Ar username Aq nobody
The username or numeric uid that will be used to process all
requests. This must not be the
.Ql root
superuser, however
.Ql nobody
or
.Ql http
are good candidates.
.It Sy GroupId Ar groupname Aq nogroup
The groupname or numeric gid that will be used to process
all requests.
.It Sy ExecAsUser Ar boolean Aq true
If enabled, filenames and CGI's in a user directory will
be read and executed with the permissions of that user.
.It Sy DefaultCharset Ar charset Aq us-ascii
The character set in which text documents will be displayed by
default. This can be overridden locally by
.Pa .charset
files. The
.Pa .charset
file should contain one line which specifies the character
set that is used for all text files in that directory (and
any subdirectories).
.It Sy UseVirtualUid Ar boolean Aq false
If enabled, files in virtual host directories will be
retrieved with the permissions of the owner over the virtual
host rootdir. This can be useful if different users maintain
different sites.
.It Sy VirtualHostDir Ar directory Ao /usr/local/lib/httpd Ac
When virtual hosts are enabled, the server also supports
.Qq automatic
detection of virtual hostnames - that is without specific
.Sy Virtual
blocks in the configuration file. If the given
.Ar directory
contains subdirectories with names that match a requested
hostname, then this subdirectory will be used as the HTML
root directory for the virtual host data. The
.Ar directory
must be an absolute path.
.It Sy UseServerSideInclude Ar boolean Aq true
By default, all HTML files will be parsed for server-side
include directives. The output of CGI scripts with the
filename prefix
.Ql ssi-
will also be checked for server-side includes. However if
this setting is turned off, SSI directives will be ignored
and files are not checked (which may slightly increase
performance of the webserver).
.It Sy UseLocalScript Ar boolean Aq true
If enabled, all directories will be checked for the presence
of a
.Pa .xsscripts
file - or the presence of
.Sy Execute
directives in
.Xr xsconf 5
files. These can be used to specify how files with certain
extensions should be handled by the webserver.
.Pp
.Pa .xsscripts
files use the exact same syntax as the global
.Pa script.methods
file, see
.Xr httpd 1
for details.
.It Sy UseScriptArgs Ar boolean Aq false
If enabled, parameters passed to scripts with a GET request
will be passed as command line options to the CGI script,
unless they contain
.Ql =
(common name-value pairs).
This is a mandatory, but little-used, requirement of the
.Xr CGI/1.1
standard. It is now disabled by default, because many script
writers don't seem to expect command line arguments.
Instead scripts tend to rely exclusively on the
.Ev QUERY_STRING
environment variable for its arguments, which always gets set,
regardless of the parameter contents.
.Pp
For example, passing the
.Fl s
option to a PHP-interpreted script, could lead to the webserver
inadvertently returning the script source.
.It Sy UseDnsLookup Ar boolean Aq true
By default, the IP addresses of incoming connections are
resolved through DNS and logged with hostname information.
You can disable this features by setting
.Sy UseDnsLookup
to
.Ql false .
Note that this will also make the environment variable
.Ev REMOTE_HOST
useless.
.It Sy UseStrictHostname Ar boolean Aq false
Setting this option will disable the use of
.Sy VirtualHostDir
and the fallback default site: only if the requested host
exactly matches a
.Sy HostName
or
.Sy HostAlias
entry, will the request be accepted and any content
displayed.
.It Sy UseAcceptFilter Ar boolean Aq false
Some systems offer kernel support to delay an
.Xr accept 2
call until (appropriate) data has actually arrived on the
socket. On FreeBSD the
.Xr accf_http 9
module can be used. Linux only has an option to wait for any
queued data. Both mechanisms can effectively reduce the
workload of the webserver, especially when you are
experiencing bogus connects. Only enable this option if your
system has indeed such a system.
.It Sy UseETag Ar boolean Aq false
If this option is enabled, entity tags will be used for static
documents (anything that is not a CGI binary or contains
server-side include directives). Browsers and web-proxies can
use this tag to determine if their cached entries are still
up-to-date. Entity tag information is based on the file
properties (such as size and modification time) rather than
the file contents. Therefor it's fast to determine, but not
perfect.
.It Sy UseCoreDump Ar boolean Aq false
This option is used for debugging only and disabled by default.
If enabled, then coredumps may be generated when the program
triggers a segmentation fault, illegal instruction, bus error
or similar fatal error condition. Whether the core image is indeed
created will depend on other factors as well: write access for
the actual uid in the working directory (often
.Pa / ) ,
available disk space and system preferences about the desirability
of uid-shifting programs dumping their state on disk.
.It Sy UseSendfile Ar boolean Aq true
Specify if
.Xr sendfile 2
should be used to transfer (binary) data files over an unencrypted
connection (images, style sheets, etc.). This may speed-up transfers
of such files. However on some systems it hinders rather than
improves performance, so it is possible to turn this off. This
option has no effect when sendfile is not available on your system.
.It Sy UseContentMD5 Ar boolean Aq false
HTTP supports checksums to validate content integrity. At the moment
only MD5 checksums are supported in HTTP/1.1. If this option is
enabled (it's disabled by default), then all data will include a
.Sy Content-MD5
header, containing the base64 encoded md5-checksum of the content.
For dynamically generated data (CGI of SSI chunked transfers)
the md5 checksum will be added to the trailers
(headers following content).
This option is only available on systems with libmd.
.It Sy UseTimestamp Ar boolean Aq true
This setting will disable timestamp-related functionality, such as
.Sy Date
and
.Sy Last-modified
HTTP headers.
This option is mandatory to comply with RFC 2616.
However, for (embedded) systems without a reliable system clock,
it make be useful to turn this off anyway.
.It Sy UsePut Ar boolean Aq true
Allow users to handle HTTP PUT and DELETE requests with local
CGI scripts.
The actual handles must be set locally with the
.Sy PutScript
and/or
.Sy DeleteScript
configuration directives as explained in
.Xr xsconf 5 .
.It Sy UseTrace Ar boolean Aq false
Allow handling of HTTP TRACE requests. This is a standard (mandatory)
HTTP command, but it may be considered a security risk.
Disabling this avoids exposing request information, such as client cookies,
but it can be enabled in development environments.
.It Sy UseSSLSessionTickets Ar boolean Aq true
Enable signed session tickets, which may be cached by clients.
This enables SSL session resumption, which may speed up
the initialisation of HTTPS connections. 
.It Sy UseSSLSessionStore Ar boolean Aq false
Maintain a local store with SSL session history.
This enables SSL session resumption, which may speed up
the initialisation of HTTPS connections. 
However, maintaining a consistent state between server processes
increases local I/O and may actually be slower in some cases.
This feature is still experimental.
.It Sy Priority Ar level Aq 0
The system priority that the daemon will be running at. A
lower priority causes more favorable scheduling.
.It Sy ScriptPriority Ar level Aq 20
The CPU priority that user CGI scripts will be running at. A
lower priority causes more favorable scheduling. The default
value is
.Dv PRIO_MAX ,
which may cause scripts to respond quite slowly, but at
least your other processes won't be suffering too much from
broken scripts.
.It Sy ScriptTimeout Ar minutes Aq 6
The time a CGI script is allowed to run before it will be
considered runaway and killed by the server. The time should
be specified in minutes. Note that several browsers will
kill a connection even earlier than this.
.It Sy ScriptCpuLimit Ar minutes Aq 2
The amount of CPU time a CGI script is allowed to use before
it will be considered runaway and killed by the server. The
time should be specified in minutes.
.It Sy ScriptEnvPath Ar path Aq /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
The
.Ev PATH
environment variable that should be presented to CGI
binaries. This must be a colon separated list of
directories; no sanity checking is done. A reasonable
default is provided.
.It Sy ScriptUmask Ar mask Aq
The umask that should be used when executing CGI scripts.
The
.Xr umask 2
mode determines the default permissions of files that are
created. For example a umask value of
.Ql 022
causes scripts to be created with mode
.Ql 644 ,
which means they will only be writable by the owner, but readable by all.
.Pp
This setting has no effect on the permission mode of the logfiles created
by the webserver.
By default, the system umask setting will be used - that is the value
that was active in the process from which the webserver was started.
.It Sy ServerIdent Bro Cm full No \*(Ba Cm branch No \*(Ba Cm name No \*(Ba Cm none Brc Aq full
Set how much of the webserver version details should be included
in the
.Sy Server
header that is sent with every HTTP response.
When set to
.Cm branch
the major version number will be show (up to the first space), with
.Cm name
only the software name will be revealed (up to the first slash).
The default behaviour is to send the full release version details.
.It Sy ProxyIdent Bro Cm full No \*(Ba Cm branch No \*(Ba Cm name No \*(Ba Cm none Brc Aq full
Set how much of the webserver version details should be included
in the
.Sy Via
header that is sent with every proxy response where data is obtained
from another webserver. The options are the same as for the
.Sy ServerIdent
directive.
.It Sy Modules Ar module Oo Ar module ... Oc Aq *
A list with the names of all dynamic modules that should
be loaded with the webserver (e.g.
.Ql perl, ldap ) .
When this option is not present or specified as the special value
.Ql Sy *
then a default list of modules will be loaded.
The list of default modules can be queried with the command
.Ql httpd -v .
.El
.Pp
The following options from old versions have been removed and 
are no longer used in the installed version.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy SystemRoot Ar directory Aq @wwwdir@
Used to set the installation version for data and configuration files.
Files are now installed in diverse locations, specified at compilation time.
Per virtual host file locations (HTML data, CGI scripts, icons, log files)
can be set using directives listed in the
.Sx Section Options
paragraph below. 
.El
.Ss Global module options
If webserver modules are enabled, additional configuration
options may be available in the global section. If the relevant
module is not available, then using such an option will generate
a fatal error.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy mod_perl
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy PerlPersistentScript Aq contrib/persistent.pl
Location of the script that is used for internal handling of
Perl CGI's.
.El
.It Sy mod_bzip
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy UseGzipCompression Aq false
Compress all data using gzip before sending it to the client -
if the client supports the gzip content encoding. Enabling this
option will affect performance, but it should reduce bandwidth usage.
There is currently no setting to exclude certain (types of) files
from this compression once enabled.
.El
.It Sy mod_magic
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy MimeMagicFile Aq
Location of the libmagic configuration file. If this is set, then
libmagic will be used as an alternative for finding the MIME type
of a file when the standard
.Xr mime.types 5
file doesn't give a conclusive result, for instance when the
requested filename does not include an extension.
This option should point to the main configuration file, without any
.Pa .mime
or
.Pa .mgc
extension, for example
.Pa /usr/share/misc/magic .
.El
.It Sy mod_rpaf
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy RpafProxyIPs Aq
List of IP addresses of reverse proxies sitting in front of the webserver.
The webserver will fake the connection address for incoming connections
coming from any of these addresses.
In stead of the proxy address, the IP address from one of the request
headers will be set as
.Ev REMOTE_ADDR
on the webserver; so that scripts will think connections come directly
from the faked address.
.It Sy RpafHeader Aq Client-IP
Name of the header set by a reverse proxy that contains the original
IP address of an incoming connection. For incoming connections from
any of the reverse proxies listed in
.Sy RpafProxyIPs
the address from this header will be set as the connection address.
.El
.El
.Ss Socket Options
It is possible to bind to multiple sockets at the same time
(e.g. http and https, or IPv4 and IPv6), using multiple
.Sy Socket
blocks in the configuration. The following options are valid
within a
.Sy Socket
block:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy ListenAddress Ar hostname Aq
The hostname or IP-address the webserver should bind on. If
the hostname resolves to multiple IP-addresses, the
webserver will only bind to the first address resolved.
.It Sy ListenPort Ar port Aq http
The service name or port number to bind on. If you want to
listen to multiple ports, you can add more Socket blocks.
The port may be either a number or a service name;
it defaults to
.Sy https
(443) when SSL is enabled for this socket and
.Sy http
(80) otherwise.
.It Sy ListenFamily Bro Cm IPv4 No \*(Ba Cm IPv6 Brc Aq
The address family to use:
.Sy IPv6
may not be available on all systems. The default is to leave
the family unspecified - which means that your operating
system can choose: in this case the httpd can even listen to
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Note that most operation
systems don't allow binding to multi-family sockets, in
which case you will need separate
.Sy Socket
blocks for IPv4 and IPv6.
.It Sy SocketName Ar key Aq
A socket name is optional and should usually not be
specified. If such a
.Ar key
is present, then connections to this socket will not use the
default settings from the
.Sy System
section, but instead use the settings from the
.Sy Virtual
section(s) with a matching
.Sy HostName .
.It Sy Instances Ar number Aq 20
The number of parallel services to run.
.It Sy UseSSL Ar boolean Aq false
If enabled, use SSL instead of plain text. This can only be
used if SSL support is enabled at compile time. If this
option is set then the https (443) port will be used by
default, instead of http (80). Note that you may include
both blocks with and without
.Sy UseSSL .
.It Sy SSLCertificate Ar filename Aq cert.pem
The location of the x509 certificate to be used for SSL
connections. This may be an absolute path or relative to
the configuration directory
.Pa ( @configdir@ ) .
This file may include a full certificate chain up to a trusted root.
When intermedicate certificates are used by the CA, they must be
listed in this file as well.
.It Sy SSLPrivateKey Ar filename Aq key.pem
The location of the x509 certificate's key to be used for SSL connections.
This may be contained in the same file as the
.Sy SSLCertificate
file. Note that this key may be protected with a secret passphrase.
In that case the server will prompt for this passphrase when started.
Do not use passphrase protection when you expect the server to start
up automatically.
.Pp
It is possible to list multiple certificates and private keys
for the same (virtual) host, but for different authentication ciphers.
These pairs must be listed with
.Sy SSLCertificate
and
.Sy SSLPrivateKey
in matching order.
Support for this is limited by OpenSSL and does not work with certificate
chains or OCSP.
Avoid using multiple keys whenever possible.
.It Sy SSLNoCert Ar boolean Aq false
Enable SSL without using a server certificate.
This will offer encryption, but no authentication (aNULL, ADH).
Setting this option generally makes no sense for public websites
and makes the service vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
This setting is not compatible with
.Sy SSLCertificate and
.Sy SSLPrivateKey
or SSL virtual hosts.
This option is only available within a
.Sy Socket
block.
.It Sy SSLAuthentication Xo
.Bro Cm none Ns No | Ns Cm optional Ns No | Ns Cm strict Brc Aq none
.Xc
This setting indicates whether clients connecting using https
should sent a client certificate to authenticate themselves.
The certificate exchange is part of the SSL handshake and
thus applies to all connections to the socket in which it is
specified.
.Pp
The default is
.Sy none :
don't request a client certificate. When set to
.Sy optional ,
the client must send an identifying cert, but this
certificate won't be checked in any way (it may be
self-signed). The most secure setting is
.Sy strict :
all client certificates will be checked and must validate
against the list of root Certificate Authorities. This
implies
.Sy SSLCAfile
or
.Sy SSLCApath :
if neither is set, checks will automatically (without
further warning) fall back to
.Sy optional
mode.
.Pp
When
.Sy SSLAuthentication
is enabled, extra environment variables are available in the
CGI environment to offer details about the client
certificate subject and issuing organisation; see
.Xr httpd_cgi 7 .
.It Sy SSLCAfile Ar filename Aq
The location of the list of x509 root certificates to be
used for validation of client certificates. This is unset by
default; although an example
.Pa caroot.pem
file is included in the distribution.
This may be an absolute path or a path relative to
the configuration directory
.Pa ( @configdir@ ) .
.It Sy SSLCApath Ar directory Aq
The location of the list of files containing x509 root
certificates to be used for validation of client certs. This
is unset by default.
This may be an absolute path or a path relative to
the configuration directory
.Pa ( @configdir@ ) .
Both
.Sy SSLCAfile
and
.Sy SSLCApath
may be set, in which case both locations will be checked for
certification authority certificates.
.It Sy SSLCRLfile Ar filename Aq
The location of the certificate revocation lists to be
used for validation of client certificates. This is unset by
default.
This may be an absolute path or a path relative to
the configuration directory
.Pa ( @configdir@ ) .
.It Sy SSLCRLpath Ar directory Aq
The location of the certificate revocation lists
to be used for validation of client certs.
This is unset by default.
This may be an absolute path or a path relative to
the configuration directory
.Pa ( @configdir@ ) .
Both
.Sy SSLCRLfile
and
.Sy SSLCRLpath
may be set, in which case both locations will be checked for
certificate revocation lists.
.It Sy SSLOCSPfile Ar filename Aq
The location of the up-to-date OCSP file to be used for
validation of the server certificate via
.Ql OCSP Stapling .
When
.Ql OCSP Stapling
is used, the signed OCSP information will be presented to
the client with the server certificate.
Clients do not need to contact the OCSP information from
a server themselves.
In this configuration, an external process must assure that the
.Sy SSLOCSPfile
is frequently refreshed, as these tend to have short expiry times
(typically between a day and a week).
This may be an absolute path or a path relative to
the database directory
.Pa ( @dbdir@ ) .
.It Sy SSLinfofile Ar filename Aq
The location of the server certificate information file.
Certificate info may contain data such as Certificate Transparancy
extensions or OCSP status information.
This option is only available when linked with a modern OpenSSL
library. See
.Xr SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file 3
for details.
This may be an absolute path or a path relative to
the database directory
.Pa ( @dbdir@ ) .
.It Sy SSLCAlist
Sets the list of acceptable certificate authorities sent to
the client when requesting a client certificate.
This only has any effect when client certificates are requested
by setting
.Sy SSLAuthentication
to
.Ql optional
or
.Ql strict .
.It Sy SSLMatchSDN Ar pcre Aq
If
.Sy SSLAuthentication
is enabled
.Pf ( Ql optional
or
. Ql strict Ns )
and PCRE support is compiled in, this expression should
match the client certificate subject as presented in the
environment variable
.Ev SSL_CLIENT_S_DN .
Otherwise the client certificate will be rejected.
.It Sy SSLMatchIDN Ar pcre Aq
If
.Sy SSLAuthentication
is enabled
.Pf ( Ql optional
or
. Ql strict Ns )
and PCRE support is compiled in, this expression should
match the client certificate issuer as presented in the
environment variable
.Ev SSL_CLIENT_I_DN .
Otherwise the client certificate will be rejected.
.It Sy SSLCipherList Ar ciphers Aq
Restrict or extend the encryption ciphers that should be used
for SSL connections. The possible values for this setting
are described in
.Xr ciphers 1 .
.El
.Ss Section Options
The following options can be set in any of the
.Sy System , Virtual
and
.Sy Users
sections:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy SSLTicketKey Ar string Aq
This value (in combination with the SSL private key)
is used to seed the key that protects SSL session tickets.
When serving a domain load-balanced with overmultiple servers,
all webservers should use the same value for the same domain.
When not set, a fixed default value will be used.
.It Sy HostName Ar hostname
The hostname of the server. This is required for a
.Sy Virtual
section. For the
.Sy System
and
.Sy Users
sections it defaults to the name of the machine.
.It Sy HostAlias Ar hostname Oo Ar hostname ... Oc Aq
One or more aliases for the previously mentioned hostname.
.It Sy PathInfoScripts Ar filename Oo Ar filename ... Oc Aq /cgi-bin/imagemap\ /cgi-bin/xschpass
One or more filenames (URIs) of scripts that should be
executed using the username path specified in the
.Ev PATH_INFO
argument.
.It Sy HtmlDir Ar directory Aq htdocs
The main directory containing all the HTML files. This
defaults to
.Pa @htmldir@
for the main server and
.Pa .html
for users (path relative to user's homedir).
It is a mandatory option in
.Sy Virtual
sections (path may be relative to
.Pa @wwwdir@ ) .
.Pp
For the
.Sy Users
section the special substring
.Ql %u
may be used in this setting, which will be replaced with the
user's login. There is no need to use this for the home
directory (as the path given is relative to the homedir),
but one might want to do something like
.Pa /data/www/%u/ .
.It Sy ExecDir Ar directory Aq cgi-bin
The
.Ar directory
containing the CGI scripts. This is the directory as it is
specified in the URL, which is not necessary the same as the
directory on disk.
.It Sy PhExecDir Ar directory Aq cgi-bin
Physical CGI directory: this is the subdirectory where
scripts are stored on disk. However if you do not use the
same value as
.Sy ExecDir ,
it is easy to get confused.
.It Sy IconDir Ar directory Aq icons
Location where the icons used by
.Xr xsindex 1
are to be found. When encountered in an URL path
prefix, files will be retreived from the
.Sy PhIconDir
directory rather than the normal path.
Beware that changing this setting only affects the
behaviour of the webserver and not the
.Xr xsindex 1
program.
.It Sy PhIconDir Ar directory Aq icons
Location where the icons used by
.Xr xsindex 1
are to be stored on disk.
.It Sy LogAccess Ar filename Aq
Logfile to use for normal HTTP requests (answered with a
.Li 2xx
response). Instead of a filename, it is possible to log to
an external process using a pipe-symbol and full pathname.
For example to enable logging through cronolog:
.Bd -literal
LogAccess  |/usr/local/sbin/cronolog /wwwsys/logs/access_%Y%m%d
.Ed
.It Sy LogError Ar filename Aq
Logfile or program to use for HTTP requests that trigger
errors (like file not found,
.Li 4xx
responses).
.It Sy LogScript Ar filename Aq
Logfile used to collect errors generated by CGI scripts.
This includes all data written to stderr by a user script
and errors from scripts that cannot be executed or produce
invalid HTTP response headers.
.It Sy LogReferer Ar filename Aq
Logfile or program to use for HTTP referrer information. Note that this
is only used when
.Sy LogStyle
.Ql traditional
is selected - otherwise referrer information will be
included in the standard
.Sy LogAccess
file.
.It Sy LogRefererIgnoreDomain Ar domain Aq
References coming from this
.Ar domain
will not be logged in the
.Sy LogReferer
file. This is usually your local network domain. Note that
it is wise to start the domain with a dot (.) to match all
hosts in the domain as well. You may also give a machine
name instead of a domain name. Note: This only affects
.Ql traditional
logging where a separate referrer logfile is used. It will be
ignored when using more modern log styles.
.It Sy LogStyle Xo
.Bro Cm traditional Ns | Ns Cm combined Ns | Ns Cm virtual Brc Aq combined
.Xc
Defines the logfile format. Traditionally access and
referrer logs will be split over two different files
.Pq Ql common logfile format ,
but using a
.Sy combined
accesslog is more common nowadays
.Pq Ql extended logfile format Ns .
The
.Sy virtual
format is basically a combined log with an extra first
field indicating the virtual hostname that was accessed on
the webserver.
.It Sy RedirFile Ar filename
Redirect all requests for this host according to the rules
listed in
.Ar filename .
This file uses the regular expression matching rules detailed in
.Xr xsredir 5 .
If this command is present,
.Sy HtmlDir
must not be set.
All requests are redirected; if none of the rules match, a
.Ql 404 not found
error will be returned.
.It Sy IndexFiles Ar filename Oo Ar filename ... Oc Aq index.html index.htm index.xhtml index.xml index.php
Defines the filename(s) that should be used when the user
asks for a directory. The webserver will never auto-generate
a directory index: you can use
.Xr xsindex 1
for that. You can specify multiple filenames separated by
commas or whitespace. The default value of
.Ql index.html index.htm index.php
means that
.Pa index.htm
will only be tried if
.Pa index.html
is not present, etc.
.Pp
If this option is omitted for the
.Sy Virtual
or
.Sy Users
section, it will default to the definition in the
.Sy System
block, or the previously mentioned default if this is also
unspecified.
.It Sy UseUsers Ar boolean Aq false
This flag controles if personal user directories (as defined in the
.Sy Users
section) will be made available through this virtual host.
If access to personal webdirectories is enabled, then these will
always be made available through the default
.Sy System
host.
However, by default personal directories cannot be accessed through
any virtual webhost definitions, unless this option is explicitly set.
This setting is only relevant in a
.Sy Virtual
section and will be ignored if it is used in any other section.
.It Sy SocketName Ar key Aq
A socket name is optional and should usually not be
specified. If such a
.Ar key
is present, then this virtual section will only be applied
to listening sockets that match the same key. There may be
multiple sockets or
.Sy Virtual
sections with the same
.Sy SocketName .
.It Sy SSLCertificate Ar filename Aq
Set an SSLCertificate for this virtual host.
This option is only available when the SSL-library supports
.Ql server name indication
(SNI).
.It Sy SSLPrivateKey Ar filename Aq
Set an SSLPrivateKey for this virtual host.
This option is only available when the SSL-library supports
.Ql server name indication
(SNI).
.It Sy UseSTS Ar boolean Aq false
Enable
.Em HTTP Strict Transport Security 
for this virtual host.
STS sites should only be visited via SSL/TLS (https).
Setting this option will generate an HTTP redirect for visitors using
the insecure HTTP port and adds an extra
.Ql Strict-Transport-Security
header for HTTPS pages. This instructs browers to use HTTPS for all
further requests to this site.
Note that the
.Sy STSMaxAge
option must be set as well; without it STS will be explicitly disabled.
.It Sy SSLOCSPfile Ar filename Aq
The location of the up-to-date OCSP file to be used for validation of
the server certificate via OCSP Stapling.
See the description of this directive in the
.Sx Section Options
overview.
.It Sy SSLinfofile Ar filename Aq
The location of the up-to-date server certificate information file
to be used for additional server certificate information.

.Sx Section Options
overview.
.It Sy STSMaxAge Ar seconds Aq 0
Set the expiry time, in seconds remaining, indicating how long
.Em HTTP Strict Transport Security
will remain active for this site.
When the life-time expires, a user agent must check the headers again
before making assumptions about STS.
Setting this value to
.Ql 0
explicitly disables STS (the default).
This option must be used in combination with
.Sy UseSTS .
.It Sy STSSubDomains Ar boolean Aq false
When this option is set, the
.Em HTTP Strict Transport Security
policy will be used for all sub domains as well.
This is merely an indication for the user agent:
This does not change the configuration of other virtual hosts.
You must still add
.Em UseSTS
to the configuration block for DNS sub domains, if they are defined
seperately in the webserver configuration.
.It Sy FcgiSocket Ar path Aq
Set the path for communication with a FastCGI daemon. This path
can either be the filename of a UNIX domain socket or a
.Oo hostname Oc : Ns port
specification. This setting is required in order to use FastCGI.
FastCGI is  not available for the
.Sy Users
section.
.It Sy FcgiPath Ar path Aq
The full pathname of the program that launches the FastCGI daemon.
This is only required if you want to launch the daemon from within
the webserver. It will use the standard uid of the virtual host block
in which it is defined. The path specification may contain a
.Sy %s
argument which will automatically be replaced with the
.Sy FcgiSocket
name specified in the same block.
.It Sy PhpFcgiChildren Ar number Aq 16
Specifically for the PHP FastCGI daemon, if launched by the webserver.
This sets the number of parallel FastCGI processes to run.
.It Sy PhpFcgiResults Ar number Aq 2000
Specifically for the PHP FastCGI daemon, if launched by the webserver.
This sets the number of requests that each process should handle.
The child processes will automatically be restarted by the FastCGI
daemon after handling the specified amount of requests.
